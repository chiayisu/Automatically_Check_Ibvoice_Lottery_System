# Automatically_Check_Invoice_Lottery_System
This is the web version of the system that I developed before for automatically checking invoice lottery.In this version, It also has some modification. You can see below.
* With more OOP concept and design patarn 
* with DataBae
  If our database have got the data from [Taiwan Ministery of Finace 財政部](https://www.etax.nat.gov.tw/etw-main/web/ETW183W1/), we will save it on databse. If anyone wants to check invoice lottery next time, our system will access data from our database intead of the website we got data befor.
# Requirement
